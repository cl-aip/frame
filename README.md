This folder includes XRL by Charniak, Riesbeck, McDermott, Meehan.

This frame system is here different from what is called “frame problem.” The former is a kind of paradigm or schema for the knowledge representation 
or the human cognitive mechanism, which is firstly proposed by Marvin Minsky. In MIT AI memo (see https://web.media.mit.edu/~minsky/papers/Frames/frames.html), 
he said “It seems to me that the ingredients of most theories both in Artificial Intelligence and in Psychology have been on the whole too minute, local, 
and unstructured to account–either practically or phenomenologically–for the effectiveness of common-sense thought. The ‘chunks’ of reasoning, language, memory, 
and ‘perception’ ought to be larger and more structured; their factual and procedural contents must be more intimately connected in order to explain the apparent power 
and speed of mental activities.” As you see, his goal of this proposal was to explain the mechanism of human efficient cognition by the frame system, 
whereas it has become a one of the way for knowledge representation as well as the rule-based systems in 1980s of the second AI booming.

Up to the present, we have had many frame systems, FRL, SRL, KRL and so on, we introduce here XRL a very compact frame system by Charniak, Riesbeck, McDermott, and Meehan, 
which is introduced in ‘Artificial Intelligence Programming’, 2nd Ed., LEA. This program is rewritten in Common Lisp as well as usual.

Note that XRL is very compact for the education and very limited for the practical use, but it provide basic features that the frame system should provide.
